With the ever evolving age comes an increased need for information security and confidentiality. As a result, a high level of security is necessary because it is an essential component of successful networks. As a result, the requirement for effective data security in various applications has necessitated a rise in research into data hiding strategies. applications in the military, copyright, ownership protection, authentication, and annotation. Data hiding calls for a carrier to conceal the audio, video, and image data it contains. A DNA reference sequence serves as the data hiding carrier in the suggested technique. The most well-known biological molecule is probably DNA, which can be found in all types of earthly life. Virtually every cell in your body contains DNA or the genetic code that makes you. DNA carries the instructions for the development, growth, reproduction, and functioning of all life. Amazingly, if all of the DNA in the human body was unravelled, it would reach to the sun and back more than 300 times Differences in the genetic code are the reason why one person has blue eyes rather than brown, why some people are susceptible to certain diseases, why birds only have two wings, and why giraffes have long necks. DNA is perhaps the most famous biological molecule; it is present in all forms of life on earth. 

 OBJECTIVE OF PROJECT
         The objective of the project is to proposes a scheme for hiding SECRET MESSAGES in living cells (SHSM) using DNA Computing combining with Steganography and Cryptography. To ensure the integrity of the message. To achieve a higher security level for hiding data within DNA sequences.To make detection even more difficult, it is possible to encrypt a DNA Sequence using modern encryption algorithms.
 PROBLEM IDENTIFIED
        Nowadays, the reliance on computer systems and the Internet has dramatically increased. The huge advancement in the technology of data storage and transmission has led to an increase in the information traffic between any two parties at an exponential rate. Many of these information are considered sensitive especially those belonging to the government, the army, or the big companies. It is quite risky to send such  information over an untrusted channel. The field of cybersecurity has the cumbersome task of protecting information from different types of threats and attacks. The attacks on shared information may cause it to be disrupted, corrupted, or stolen. 
1.3.1 What is DNA?
In short, DNA is a long molecule that contains each person’s unique genetic code. It holds the instructions for building the proteins that are essential for our bodies to function.
DNA instructions are passed from parent to child, with roughly half of a child’s DNA originating from the father and half from the mother.
Most DNA lives in the nuclei of cells and some is found in mitochondria, which are the powerhouses of the cells.
Because we have so much DNA (2 meters in each cell) and our nuclei are so small, DNA has to be packaged incredibly neatly.
Strands of DNA are looped, coiled and wrapped around proteins called histones. In this coiled state, it is called chromatin.
Chromatin is further condensed, through a process called supercoiling, and it is then packaged into structures called chromosomes. These chromosomes form the familiar “X” shape as seen in the image above.
Each chromosome contains one DNA molecule. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes or 46 chromosomes in total. Interestingly, fruit flies have 8 chromosomes, and pigeons have 80.
Chromosome 1 is the largest and contains around 8,000 genes. The smallest is chromosome 21 with around 3,000 genes.

 DNA CRYPTOGRAPHY
Cryptography is the branch of science which deals with the encoding of information for the purpose of hiding messages. It plays a vital role in the infrastructure of communication security. The Pioneering work had been done by Ashish Gehani et al and Amin et al after Leonard Max Adleman had shown the capability of molecular computation in 1994. This paved the way for DNA Computing. DNA Cryptology combines cryptology and modern biotechnology.
So, how do encode data in a DNA strand which is mainly made, up of 4 nitrogenous bases namely:
Adenine (A)
Thymine (T)
Cytosine (C)
Guanine (G)
The easiest way to encode is to represent these four units as four figures:
A(0) –00
T(1) –01
C(2)–10
G(3)–11 
By these encoding rules, there are 4!=24 possible encoding methods. Based on some principles as A and G make pairs while T and C make pairs.
Of those 24 methods, only 8 match the DNA pairing rule but the best encoding scheme is 0123/CTAG.
So now converted our initial number into a sequence of A, T, G and C theoretically. This is then physically implemented using various DNA synthesizing techniques like Chemical Oligonucleotide Synthesis and Oligo Synthesis Platforms (this includes Column-Based Oligo Synthesis, Array-based Oligo Synthesis, Complex Strand and Gene Synthesis and Error Correction).
